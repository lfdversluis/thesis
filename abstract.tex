Performance is a make-or-break quality for software.
When making changes it is essential to ensure no \emph{performance regression} has occurred i.e. the program performs more slowly or consumes more resources than previous versions.
Tribler is the result of ten years scientific research in complex distributed systems.
Over the course of years Tribler's performance has fallen below acceptable user experience levels.
All past attempts to gain insight into key performance indicators have failed.

By making use of \emph{software performance engineering}, we address Tribler's dramatic performance.
We resolve Tribler's blocking synchronous I/O, the main bottleneck, by introducing asynchrony and show that we improve the performance i.e. responsiveness significantly.
Additionally we implement a regression testing system to prevent the deterioration of performance in the future, making Tribler ready for large scale usage and another decade of research.

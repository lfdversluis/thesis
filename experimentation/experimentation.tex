\section{Performance analysis}
To observe the current situation, we have measured Tribler running idle (i.e. no human interaction) for 4 hours.
For this experiment we run Tribler version 6.6.0-exp1 which is a pre-release of 6.6, because it includes the MultiChain code.
The hardware used during this experiment can be seen in Table \ref{table:tribler_idle}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|l}
		\textbf{Component} 	& \textbf{Specifications} \\ \hline
		Operating System   	& Ubuntu 16.04 LTS \\
		CPU					& Intel Core i5-2410M \\ 
		HDD					& Samsung 850 EVO 250GB  \\ 
		RAM					& 8 GB DDR3 1600MHz \\

\end{figure} 

The results are visible in Figure~\ref{fig:htop_io_idle_run}. \todo{cut unity desktop}
From these results we observe that Tribler current has an IO of 144 MB/Hour.
To observe the individual components separately, we have created a breakdown the database queries performed by Tribler.
This breakdown is visible in Table Z.
As we can see, B is doing the most IO... \todo{Implement breakdown functionality and measure this.}

\section{Performance regression using Gumby}

\end{figure} 

Tribler has an experiment runner framework for Dispersy and Tribler: Gumby.
Using Gumby, one can specify configurations and scenario files to be executed.

Configuration files specify all the settings needed in order to run an experiment using Gumby.
The scenario file allows for a carefully timed execution of functions.
Each line in a scenario file specifies which node executes which function at what time. \todo{Example of such a scenario file? yes/no?}
Currently, Gumby is being used to run an experiment on the DAS5 super computer\footnote{\url{http://www.cs.vu.nl/das5/}}.
Whenever a push happens on a pull request on GitHub, our Jenkins continuous integration system automatically schedules this experiment to be run.

Using Gumby, statistics such as CPU, memory consumption and I/O are automatically tracked.
Any additional information that one wishes to track can be logged and parsed using auxiliary post experiment scripts.
Currently, graphs are being generated in the R programming language using the ggplot2 library.

To obtain a regression testing system, we decided to extend Gumby.
To obtain the data for comparison, the proposed commits first have to be run inside an experiment using a predetermined scenario and configuration file.
Once this experiment is done, Jenkins can fetch the data of the last successful experiment run of the current code base.
Next, using the data from both experiments we generate graphs.
By creating a side-by-side plot of two graphs using the same scales, developers can immediately see any changes, see Figure~\ref{fig:side_by_side_send}.\todo{Replace the right one with the dispersy async + non-block, should be more of a change.}

\section{Validating the performance regression system}

To validate the performance regression system, we have resolved one of Tribler's biggest bottlenecks: Dispersy's database I/O.
Dispersy performs a lot of I/O.
Currently, this I/O is blocking the main thread when waiting for the database, wasting valuable CPU cycles.
To address this problem, we have written Dispersy's I/O to become asynchronous and non-blocking.
To realize this, a new database manager \enquote{StormDBManager} is introduced and 90\%\todo{made up number, need to calculate the actual value.} of Dispersy's functions have been refactored.

\subsection{A new database manager}


\subsection{Refactoring Dispersy}

As the new StormDBManager will start retuning deferreds, functions of Dispersy need to be able to coop with this new paradigm.
Every caller of this function will need to be recursively updated as well to handle the deferreds being returned.
By making extensive use of the \enquote{inlineCallbacks}\footnote{\url{http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks.html}} decorator, approximately 90\% of all Dispersy functions were modified. \todo{Replace 90\% with actual number.}
\todo{continue story.}

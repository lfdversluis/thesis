\section{Performance analysis}
To observe the current situation, we have measured Tribler running idle (i.e. no human interaction) for X hours. \todo{Perform experiment and fill in values.}
For this experiment we run Tribler version 6.6.0-exp1 which is a pre-release of 6.6, because it includes the MultiChain code.
The hardware used during this experiment can be seen in Table \ref{table:tribler_idle}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|l}
		Hardware	& Specifications \\ \hline
		CPU			&  \\ 
		HDD			&  \\ 
		RAM			&  \\
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Hardware used during the idle iotop measurement of Tribler 6.6.0-pre-exp.}
	\label{table:tribler_idle}
\end{table}

The results are visible in Figure X.
From these results we observe that Tribler current has an IO of Y.
To observe the individual components separately, we have created a breakdown the database queries performed by Tribler.
This breakdown is visible in Table Z.
As we can see, B is doing the most IO... \todo{Fill in the stuff when experiment done}

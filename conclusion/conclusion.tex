Future work

\begin{itemize}
	\item Move storage to a per-community level. This will mean less flushing of data when sending items. In Tribler one only sends messages in the allchannel and to the channelcommunity (if you own a channel).
	\item A threadpool with sqlite3 multithreaded enabled? 
	\item Move database stuff into classes and use Storm's ORM. That auto-caches items, doesn't commit immediately.
	\item Extend the regression test system with more metrics? Memory, network etc. ?
\end{itemize}

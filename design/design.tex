\chapter{Design \& Implementation}

With the recent addition of the MultiChain there are three distinct database files with three distinct database managers present in the Tribler code base.
None these database managers are fully documented or tested.
A proper solution is to merge these three databases files into a single database, controlled by a single database manager.
This will result in less code to maintain, all logic in one place and easier to cover with proper unit tests and documentation.
Ideally this database manager should handle all communication to and from the database in an asynchronous, non-blocking manner.
This will yield increased stability and speed, improved maintainability and enhances the productivity of developers.

\subsection{A new framework}
Storm was chosen but why... explained here..

Tribler has Twisted integration, we would like to have a manager that supports Twisted...
First mention of Twisted in Dispersy: \url{https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/issues/129} but was never done.
Until now.

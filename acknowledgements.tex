This thesis presents the work I have conducted in the last ten months.
During this period, I have had the pleasure of meeting new people who made my time much more enjoyable.
I would like to thank some people who contributed to this thesis.
Firstly, I would like to thank Johan Pouwelse for offering me this thesis and providing feedback on my work.
Secondly, I would like to thank Elric Milon who shared his knowledge of Tribler, Python, Git and Emacs with me as well as maintaining and updating our infrastructure from which everyone profited.
Thirdly, I am grateful to Pim Otte and Selina Versluis for providing feedback on my work.
I would also like to thank both Martijn and Hans, who I have spent the most time with in the MSc lab and for occasionally helping me when struggling with Linux.
Next, I would like to thank Ernst, Niels, Paul and everyone else of the Tribler team for providing feedback and suggestions.
Last but not least, I would like to thank my friends and family for their support, motivation and encouragement throughout my thesis.

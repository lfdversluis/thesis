\chapter{IO in Tribler}

Tribler's IO has been a problem for years \cite{pouwelse2014reduce}.
In May 2013 Tribler read and wrote 660 Megabytes per hour to and from disk.
Back in April 2014 this number was somewhat reduced to 623.
In May 2014 efforts were made to reduce this enormous amount of IO and after batching several database statements the number further dropped to 538 Megabytes per hour.
Since then there has not been any work on this topic any more.

In the meantime, Tribler has seen several changes to its code base including the addition of the Multi-Chain: Tribler's own block-chain like structure.
This feature will have it's own database, performing additional IO.
Furthermore, a feature called ``credit mining'' is currently in development that will also interact with the databases of Tribler and its components.
There are no metrics on the current situation of Tribler and it's hard if not impossible to estimate the impact of the additions to come.

To observe the current situation, Tribler was activated and ran idle (i.e. no human interaction) for X hours.
The results are visible in Figure X.
From these results we observe that Tribler current has an IO of Y.
To observe the individual components separately, we have created a breakdown the database queries performed by Tribler.
This breakdown is visible in Table Z.
As we can see, B is doing the most IO... \todo{Fill in the stuff when experiment done}
